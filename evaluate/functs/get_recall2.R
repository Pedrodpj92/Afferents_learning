## Notes:
##    in:
##      - table_in
##    out:
##      - rec2_out
##    This is a special case, where the "total positives" (TP+FN) is greater than observed cases
##    For instance, we have 114 positive cases in R1, but there are 181 spikes in total
##    Currently, should give the same results as recall because empty intervals with
##    afferent spike but not other neuron activity are added to preprocess.
##    But it is not removed for testing pourpose or future casuistic
