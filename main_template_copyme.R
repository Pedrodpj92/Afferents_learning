#check with getwd() and change with setwd()

#this will save a log file, if you don't want to save it, comment the following line and
#the last line with the sink() function at the end of this code
# sink("./log_dd-mm-yyyy.txt", append=FALSE, split=TRUE)
# sink() #if the program did a execution with errors, call this function in order to close the log file

##this is the handler who calls each workflow
##See the main parameters of this function:
# - config_data_id: the identifier that you used in configuration tables.
#                   Do not use the reserved word "default" as id, used for "configuration by user" way
# - vec_random_seed: vector of integers that will be used for set seed.
#                     In this example, there are 30, but you can use the vector that you wish
#                     even, just one number, 123 for example
# - wf_calls: workflows that should be done.
#             Options are: randomSeeds, individual, combinatory, recursive, iterative
#             In this template you start without combinatory because it spend a lot of time,
#             but you can add it if you want to perform a combinatory workflow
#             feel free for adapt for your case.
dt_results <- workflow_commander(config_data_id = "id_template_changeMe", #change the name with the proper data_id that you used
                             vec_random_seed = c(1:30)+100,
                             wf_calls = c("randomSeeds","individual",
                                          "recursive","iterative"))

# you can also call several times to workflow_commander and perform many configurations
# in the same script. See examples for inspire you
# dt_results2 <- workflow_commander(config_data_id = "Other_id_that_you_can_change_here",
#                              vec_random_seed = c(1:30)+100,
#                              wf_calls = c("randomSeeds","individual"))

#dt_results is a list which contains structures of each workflow called,
#you can call each structure by its own name of workflow, as following example
# dt_results$randomSeeds
# or
# dt_results$individual

#inside each object for each workflow result, you can access to information and tables
#explore results and save what you wish
# results_mean <- dt_exp$randomSeeds$mean
# or
# results_rankVI_example <- dt_exp$randomSeeds$rank_VI[[1]]

#in following updates, in each workflow will be appear a description of each object returned by the functions

#you can save each data frame using the following lines, copy and adapt them as you prefer
dt_example_output <- dt_results$randomSeeds$mean
