## File name: check_and_clean_individuals.R
##
## Purpose of file: Remove results in metrics_per_neuron file with data_id coincidence as key
##                    Needed in case of "default" way (data_id=="default"),
##                    because each run different data may be used.
##                    So... individual analysis ought to be done and saved before iterative.
